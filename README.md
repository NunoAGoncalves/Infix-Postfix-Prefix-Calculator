# Infix Postfix Prefix Calculator :triangular_ruler: :memo:

A short open-source program that detects whether an equation is in infix, postfix or prefix notation and then calculates the answer of the equation and prints it for the user.

The program works by checking the format of the equation and using the penultimate and final index of the equation to determine its notation. After finding the correct notation, the program then calls an appropriate function to return the answer of the equation (depending on its notation).
